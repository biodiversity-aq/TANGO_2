The “homemade” type of trap used during the expedition are composed of a coarse plastic mesh for protection of a 500µ fine mesh rolled around two rings of PVC pipes to produce a cylinder of 15x40 cm. Both end of the trap are equipped with a funnel with a 2 cm opening directed inward to prevent organisms to escape after penetrating the trap. The bait used consists of mackerel tied inside the trap. Traps are deployed in pairs, secured together with a metal frame. A 5kg ballast weight is used to anchor the traps on ground level. The system holds to a rope equipped with a sailing buoy floating at the surface for easy spotting and recovery of the trap. The device is deployed for a minimum of 24 hours and maximum 48 hours. Longer deployment may allow scavengers to completely consume the bait, roam around and eventually escape from the trap. Shorter deployment time may not provide enough time for detection of the bait by the scavenger. At each sampling station, AT were deployed at two different locations bringing the deployment total to 6 AT for the TANGO2 expedition.

The ROV was deployed from the Australis itself or from a Bombard C4 tender. With a person managing the tether to assist the pilot. GPS coordinates were taken on the surface using a handheld GPS (Garmin Oregon 600), then the ROV headed straight downwards until reaching the bottom. It was then flown at a constant altitude above the seafloor (1 meter), with a known bearing, for approx. 15 minutes at a pace of 0,1m/s, resulting in transects between 90-110 meters, depending on the geomorphological characteristics of the site. Then, it was brought back straight upwards to the surface and a second GPS point was recorded. If, for weather or logistic reasons, it was not possible to retrieve the second GPS point, it was calculated afterwards using distance and bearing.

It was then flown at a constant altitude above the seafloor (1 meter), with a known bearing, for approx. 15 minutes at a pace of 0,1m/s, resulting in transects between 90-110 meters, depending on the geomorphological characteristics of the site. Then, it was brought back straight upwards to the surface and a second GPS point was recorded. If, for weather or logistic reasons, it was not possible to retrieve the second GPS point, it was calculated afterwards using distance and bearing.

This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface. The whole device containing the samples in its bags is placed in a bucket for further processing on the ship’s deck. A total of 15 RD was deployed during the TANGO2 expedition at each station’s point of interest (deeper “pools”, canyons, channel slope, plateau).

The ROV was deployed from the Australis itself or from a Bombard C4 tender. With a person managing the tether to assist the pilot. GPS coordinates were taken on the surface using a handheld GPS (Garmin Oregon 600), then the ROV headed straight downwards until reaching the bottom. It was then flown at a constant altitude above the seafloor (1 meter), with a known bearing, for approx. 15 minutes at a pace of 0,1m/s, resulting in transects between 90-110 meters, depending on the geomorphological characteristics of the site. Then, it was brought back straight upwards to the surface and a second GPS point was recorded. If, for weather or logistic reasons, it was not possible to retrieve the second GPS point, it was calculated afterwards using distance and bearing.

The “homemade” type of trap used during the expedition are composed of a coarse plastic mesh for protection of a 500µ fine mesh rolled around two rings of PVC pipes to produce a cylinder of 15x40 cm. Both end of the trap are equipped with a funnel with a 2 cm opening directed inward to prevent organisms to escape after penetrating the trap. The bait used consists of mackerel tied inside the trap. Traps are deployed in pairs, secured together with a metal frame. A 5kg ballast weight is used to anchor the traps on ground level. The system holds to a rope equipped with a sailing buoy floating at the surface for easy spotting and recovery of the trap. The device is deployed for a minimum of 24 hours and maximum 48 hours. Longer deployment may allow scavengers to completely consume the bait, roam around and eventually escape from the trap. Shorter deployment time may not provide enough time for detection of the bait by the scavenger. At each sampling station, AT were deployed at two different locations bringing the deployment total to 6 AT for the TANGO2 expedition.

This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface.

This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface. The whole device containing the samples in its bags is placed in a bucket for further processing on the ship’s deck. A total of 15 RD was deployed during the TANGO2 expedition at each station’s point of interest (deeper “pools”, canyons, channel slope, plateau).

The “homemade” type of trap used during the expedition are composed of a coarse plastic mesh for protection of a 500µ fine mesh rolled around two rings of PVC pipes to produce a cylinder of 15x40 cm. Both end of the trap are equipped with a funnel with a 2 cm opening directed inward to prevent organisms to escape after penetrating the trap. The bait used consists of mackerel tied inside the trap. Traps are deployed in pairs, secured together with a metal frame. A 5kg ballast weight is used to anchor the traps on ground level. The system holds to a rope equipped with a sailing buoy floating at the surface for easy spotting and recovery of the trap. The device is deployed for a minimum of 24 hours and maximum 48 hours. Longer deployment may allow scavengers to completely consume the bait, roam around and eventually escape from the trap. Shorter deployment time may not provide enough time for detection of the bait by the scavenger. At each sampling station, AT were deployed at two different locations bringing the deployment total to 6 AT for the TANGO2 expedition.

The ROV was deployed from the Australis itself or from a Bombard C4 tender. With a person managing the tether to assist the pilot. GPS coordinates were taken on the surface using a handheld GPS (Garmin Oregon 600), then the ROV headed straight downwards until reaching the bottom. It was then flown at a constant altitude above the seafloor (1 meter), with a known bearing, for approx. 15 minutes at a pace of 0,1m/s, resulting in transects between 90-110 meters, depending on the geomorphological characteristics of the site. Then, it was brought back straight upwards to the surface and a second GPS point was recorded. If, for weather or logistic reasons, it was not possible to retrieve the second GPS point, it was calculated afterwards using distance and bearing.

This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface. The whole device containing the samples in its bags is placed in a bucket for further processing on the ship’s deck. A total of 15 RD was deployed during the TANGO2 expedition at each station’s point of interest (deeper “pools”, canyons, channel slope, plateau).

The ROV was deployed from the Australis itself or from a Bombard C4 tender. With a person managing the tether to assist the pilot. GPS coordinates were taken on the surface using a handheld GPS (Garmin Oregon 600), then the ROV headed straight downwards until reaching the bottom. It was then flown at a constant altitude above the seafloor (1 meter), with a known bearing, for approx. 15 minutes at a pace of 0,1m/s, resulting in transects between 90-110 meters, depending on the geomorphological characteristics of the site. Then, it was brought back straight upwards to the surface and a second GPS point was recorded. If, for weather or logistic reasons, it was not possible to retrieve the second GPS point, it was calculated afterwards using distance and bearing.

This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface. The whole device containing the samples in its bags is placed in a bucket for further processing on the ship’s deck. A total of 15 RD was deployed during the TANGO2 expedition at each station’s point of interest (deeper “pools”, canyons, channel slope, plateau).

This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface. The whole device containing the samples in its bags is placed in a bucket for further processing on the ship’s deck. A total of 15 RD was deployed during the TANGO2 expedition at each station’s point of interest (deeper “pools”, canyons, channel slope, plateau).

The “homemade” type of trap used during the expedition are composed of a coarse plastic mesh for protection of a 500µ fine mesh rolled around two rings of PVC pipes to produce a cylinder of 15x40 cm. Both end of the trap are equipped with a funnel with a 2 cm opening directed inward to prevent organisms to escape after penetrating the trap. The bait used consists of mackerel tied inside the trap. Traps are deployed in pairs, secured together with a metal frame. A 5kg ballast weight is used to anchor the traps on ground level. The system holds to a rope equipped with a sailing buoy floating at the surface for easy spotting and recovery of the trap. The device is deployed for a minimum of 24 hours and maximum 48 hours. Longer deployment may allow scavengers to completely consume the bait, roam around and eventually escape from the trap. Shorter deployment time may not provide enough time for detection of the bait by the scavenger. At each sampling station, AT were deployed at two different locations bringing the deployment total to 6 AT for the TANGO2 expedition.

The “homemade” type of trap used during the expedition are composed of a coarse plastic mesh for protection of a 500µ fine mesh rolled around two rings of PVC pipes to produce a cylinder of 15x40 cm. Both end of the trap are equipped with a funnel with a 2 cm opening directed inward to prevent organisms to escape after penetrating the trap. The bait used consists of mackerel tied inside the trap. Traps are deployed in pairs, secured together with a metal frame. A 5kg ballast weight is used to anchor the traps on ground level. The system holds to a rope equipped with a sailing buoy floating at the surface for easy spotting and recovery of the trap. The device is deployed for a minimum of 24 hours and maximum 48 hours. Longer deployment may allow scavengers to completely consume the bait, roam around and eventually escape from the trap. Shorter deployment time may not provide enough time for detection of the bait by the scavenger. At each sampling station, AT were deployed at two different locations bringing the deployment total to 6 AT for the TANGO2 expedition.

This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface. The whole device containing the samples in its bags is placed in a bucket for further processing on the ship’s deck. A total of 15 RD was deployed during the TANGO2 expedition at each station’s point of interest (deeper “pools”, canyons, channel slope, plateau).

This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface. The whole device containing the samples in its bags is placed in a bucket for further processing on the ship’s deck. A total of 15 RD was deployed during the TANGO2 expedition at each station’s point of interest (deeper “pools”, canyons, channel slope, plateau).

The “homemade” type of trap used during the expedition are composed of a coarse plastic mesh for protection of a 500µ fine mesh rolled around two rings of PVC pipes to produce a cylinder of 15x40 cm. Both end of the trap are equipped with a funnel with a 2 cm opening directed inward to prevent organisms to escape after penetrating the trap. The bait used consists of mackerel tied inside the trap. Traps are deployed in pairs, secured together with a metal frame. A 5kg ballast weight is used to anchor the traps on ground level. The system holds to a rope equipped with a sailing buoy floating at the surface for easy spotting and recovery of the trap. The device is deployed for a minimum of 24 hours and maximum 48 hours. Longer deployment may allow scavengers to completely consume the bait, roam around and eventually escape from the trap. Shorter deployment time may not provide enough time for detection of the bait by the scavenger. At each sampling station, AT were deployed at two different locations bringing the deployment total to 6 AT for the TANGO2 expedition.

This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface. The whole device containing the samples in its bags is placed in a bucket for further processing on the ship’s deck. A total of 15 RD was deployed during the TANGO2 expedition at each station’s point of interest (deeper “pools”, canyons, channel slope, plateau).

This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface. The whole device containing the samples in its bags is placed in a bucket for further processing on the ship’s deck. A total of 15 RD was deployed during the TANGO2 expedition at each station’s point of interest (deeper “pools”, canyons, channel slope, plateau).

The ROV was deployed from the Australis itself or from a Bombard C4 tender. With a person managing the tether to assist the pilot. GPS coordinates were taken on the surface using a handheld GPS (Garmin Oregon 600), then the ROV headed straight downwards until reaching the bottom. It was then flown at a constant altitude above the seafloor (1 meter), with a known bearing, for approx. 15 minutes at a pace of 0,1m/s, resulting in transects between 90-110 meters, depending on the geomorphological characteristics of the site. Then, it was brought back straight upwards to the surface and a second GPS point was recorded. If, for weather or logistic reasons, it was not possible to retrieve the second GPS point, it was calculated afterwards using distance and bearing.

Remarkably, very low densities of birds during both crossings of the Drake Passage were observed compared to similar crossings performed at similar dates during previous years. Several species, although normally common or frequently observed during such transect e.g., the Southern Royal Albatross (Diomedea epomophora), Snow Petrel (Pagodroma nivea), White-headed Petrel (Pterodroma lessonii), Antarctic Petrel (Thalassoica antarctica), Kerguelen Petrel (Lugensa brevirostris) or Blue petrel (Halobaena caerulea) were absent during this voyage.
