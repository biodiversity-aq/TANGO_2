AT	Amphipod Trap	Amphipod Trap | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11653690 | Baited “amphipod trap” (AT) are used to capture scavenging communities present in the selected areas. The “homemade” type of trap used during the expedition are composed of a coarse plastic mesh for protection of a 500µ fine mesh rolled around two rings of PVC pipes to produce a cylinder of 15x40 cm. Both end of the trap are equipped with a funnel with a 2 cm opening directed inward to prevent organisms to escape after penetrating the trap. The bait used consists of mackerel tied inside the trap. Traps are deployed in pairs, secured together with a metal frame. A 5kg ballast weight is used to anchor the traps on ground level. The system holds to a rope equipped with a sailing buoy floating at the surface for easy spotting and recovery of the trap. The device is deployed for a minimum of 24 hours and maximum 48 hours. Longer deployment may allow scavengers to completely consume the bait, roam around and eventually escape from the trap. Shorter deployment time may not provide enough time for detection of the bait by the scavenger. At each sampling station, AT were deployed at two different locations bringing the deployment total to 6 AT for the TANGO2 expedition.
NIS	Niskin bottle	Niskin bottle | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11653690 | Water samples were collected using Niskin bottles during NIS events as part of the expedition environmental parameters and biogeochemistry work. See Table 5 (Parameters to be measured in the water column) and Table 11 (Overview of the sampling effort … (DIV = diving event, NIS = Niskin event)) for the list of parameters and station-level sampling effort details.
DRM	Drone Mapping	Drone Mapping | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11653690 | Aerial footage was shot by Bruno Danis, Camille Moreau and Henri Robert using DJI MavicPro2, DJI Mavic Mini Pro3 drones, for mapping, photogrammetry and documentation purposes. Drone-derived media were gathered in the framework of the expedition, both for outreach and research purposes.
ITD	Intertidal	Intertidal | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11653690 | Intertidal is listed among the gear deployed during the TANGO 2 expedition (Table 3: List of gear deployed during the TANGO 2 expedition).
RD	Rauschert Dredge	Rauschert Dredge | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11653690 | A “Rauschert” dredge (RD) was used at each working area to sample the general macro-benthic communities. This small dredge designed by Biologist Martin Rauschert (AWI) several decades ago is an excellent tool (widely used in the scientific benthic research community) to capture a large diversity of specimen of all taxa and keep them in a good shape for further identification and processing. The dredge consists of a 50x50x20 cm double sided sledge-like metal frame that slides on the sea floor (on either side). Organisms are lifted from the sediment surface by a chain that scrapes the seabed under the dredge’s frame. At the bottom of the dredge a large 50x70x20 cm bag of 500µ mesh is attached to collect all the floating organisms lifted by the chain. This collecting bag is protected by a coarse nylon 1 cm mesh size bag to support the weight of the sample collected. Both bags are protected on top and at the bottom by a rubber carpet that covers the whole surface of the collecting bag. The RD is usually deployed from a zodiac but can also be deployed from the deck of Australis. The RD is being held and hauled by a rope of at least 1.5 times the length of the depth of deployment. A distance of 100 meter is travelled to the end point of deployment at very low speed that allows the dredge to sweep the sea floor without floating above the ground. At the end point the rope is pulled by hand until the RD reaches the water surface. The whole device containing the samples in its bags is placed in a bucket for further processing on the ship’s deck. A total of 15 RD was deployed during the TANGO2 expedition at each station’s point of interest (deeper “pools”, canyons, channel slope, plateau).
ROV	Remotely Operated Vehicle	Remotely Operated Vehicle | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11653690 | A small affordable Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), the BlueROV2 from BlueRobotics, was equipped with a downward looking GoPro (HERO10), a single-beam sonar and a pair of lasers. The ROV was deployed from the Australis itself or from a Bombard C4 tender. With a person managing the tether to assist the pilot. GPS coordinates were taken on the surface using a handheld GPS (Garmin Oregon 600), then the ROV headed straight downwards until reaching the bottom. It was then flown at a constant altitude above the seafloor (1 meter), with a known bearing, for approx. 15 minutes at a pace of 0,1m/s, resulting in transects between 90-110 meters, depending on the geomorphological characteristics of the site. Then, it was brought back straight upwards to the surface and a second GPS point was recorded. If, for weather or logistic reasons, it was not possible to retrieve the second GPS point, it was calculated afterwards using distance and bearing.
DIV	Scuba Divers	Scuba Divers | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11653690 | Diving activities are reported in the cruise report (see Table 17 Summary of diving activities during TANGO2). Underwater imagery was shot by the divers Team (Lucas Terrana, Lea Katz, Camille Moreau, Martin Dogniez and Anthony Voisin).

TOP	Top Predator Census	Top Predator Census | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11653690 | Regarding Top Predators (Birds and Marine Mammals), a total of 64 observation events (standard counts or punctual observations) were performed while crossing the Magellanic Area (MA), the Drake Passage (DP) and along the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). General notes on the observations for each species encountered during the voyage were taken. Remarkably, very low densities of birds during both crossings of the Drake Passage were observed compared to similar crossings performed at similar dates during previous years. Several species, although normally common or frequently observed during such transect e.g., the Southern Royal Albatross (Diomedea epomophora), Snow Petrel (Pagodroma nivea), White-headed Petrel (Pterodroma lessonii), Antarctic Petrel (Thalassoica antarctica), Kerguelen Petrel (Lugensa brevirostris) or Blue petrel (Halobaena caerulea) were absent during this voyage.
